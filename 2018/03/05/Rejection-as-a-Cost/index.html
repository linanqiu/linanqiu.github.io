        <p>Recently I’ve been talking to several friends about job / internship hunting and an interesting problem is emerging. Tell me if the following sounds familiar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Why should I try for this job? I’ll definitely get rejected.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to apply for this job because I don’t think I’m good enough. I probably won’t make the cut.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="cost-and-expected-utility">Cost and Expected Utility</h2>
<p>Now let’s think about the cost of applying for an additional (marginal) job given that you are already applying for jobs. You do have to do some research about the new company and new role. However, since you’re already applying to some jobs, <strong>I’d argue that you’re actually not incurring much additional cost.</strong> Sure you’d spend 10 to 15 more minutes researching about a specific company. But when you’re already familiar with the industry, all you need is a cursory glance at the company’s wiki / do a quick google search to have enough shpiel to last the phone interview. And as for phone interviews, you’re not even incurring those costs yet. Furthermore, turning the job down <em>after</em> you’ve made it past the resume screen before the interview is still an option if you do apply for the job. So the additional effort to interview is neither a marginal cost nor an immediately applicable cost.</p>
<p>So the cost of applying to an additional job when you’re already on the hunt is <strong>minimal</strong>.</p>
<p>What about the expected utility of a job? That’s just the probability of you getting the role times the utility you’d receive from successfully getting the role. That utility is obviously non-trivial, so we can make the argument that the expected utility probably outweighs the cost even if you have a very slim probability of getting it. (Feel free to argue otherwise, but I don’t think this requires much more explanation.)</p>
<p>Furthermore, you can always just apply to a ton of jobs, get a ton of offers, and bid them up and watch them suffer. Why would one voluntarily <em>not</em> apply for a job? The rational thing a homo-economicus would do is to apply for a ton of jobs. And I still insist that’s the rational thing to do and one that I have been recommending my friends do.</p>
<p>However, people don’t behave in such a manner – at least not intuitively.</p>
<p>I’m starting to toy with the idea that <strong>rejection itself is a cost</strong>, or rather <strong>people treat rejection as a loss</strong> rather than a <strong>forgone gain</strong>. The distinction is important.</p>
<h2 id="prospect-theory">Prospect Theory</h2>
<p>In classic utility theory, one’s utility is merely a state function. Using wealth as an example, a utility function could be <span class="math inline">\(U(W) = \log(W)\)</span> ala Bernoulli. This utility function demonstrates diminishing sensitivity and hence risk aversion among other things. I won’t go into the details of that function right now. Using this function, going from a state of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(W + job\)</span> is an absolute increase in utility. Pair that with whatever probability one would get a job and we should see positive utility from applying for the job. That’s what I expected as well.</p>
<p>However, people seem to conform more to a different model. In particular, people seem to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Begin to ponder if they should apply for a job</li>
<li>When they do, they kind of expect that they would get the job. In other words, they have shifted their reference point from one of not expecting a job to one that expects a job. They experience “hope” and probably some amount of fantasized happiness about getting the job.</li>
<li>Now if they do succeed in getting the role, they move further up the curve and experience a “gain” from the original point where they expect a job.</li>
<li>However, and more importantly, if they do not get the role, they move <strong>down</strong> the curve and experience a <strong>“loss”</strong>. In other words, they feel disappointed that they did not get the job. Their fantasy is shattered, and something (probably hearts) is broken. In fact, you know that they experience a loss and not a forgone gain when they experience disappointment – people are less likely to be disappointed at a forgone gain (are you ever disappointed that you did NOT pick up a bill on the floor? Or get upgraded to a business class flight?) than a loss (you feel like something somewhat belonged to you already, and now you don’t have it)</li>
</ul>
<p>This distinction can be framed using prospect theory.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Valuefun.jpg" alt="This is the famous prospect theory loss and gain graph. The gains portion on the positive X-axis exhibits the same properties as the classic utility function. However, on the loss side (negative X-axis), the value decreases decreasingly (i.e. people treat large losses with diminishing sensitivity as well). Furthermore, in the immediate vicinity of the reference point, losses are steeper than gains. That means people feel losing more acutely than gaining the same amount. This should be rather obvious – just think about how sad you’d be if you lost \$50 vs. picking up \$50 on the street.">

</div>
<p>When one applies (or even thinks about applying) for a job with the hope of getting it, one immediately moves one’s reference point to a “somewhat in-between” state where one somewhat expects to get the job. In this state, losses outweigh gains, so the expect prospective utility would be skewed in favor of losses. Possible losses appear more painful, and hence the prospect of being disappointed overwhelms the contrapositive event.</p>
<p>In fact we can already observe this in action in the markets. When a buyer announces her intent to purchase a company in a deal, the company’s stocks jump up in anticipation of the takeover, but not to the full extent of the announced price (to price in possible failure). That’s how merger arbitrage traders make money. The initial jump is the market expressing a shift in reference point such that a failed takeover is viewed as a loss.</p>
<h2 id="mind-tricks">Mind Tricks</h2>
<p>However, viewing this as a loss is still inherently irrational (even if we can explain it psychologically); it results in applicants applying for fewer jobs than they would have if they had truly matched cost with benefits. They’d get fewer offers, compete offers less, and overall be in a crappier spot.</p>
<p>Knowing this, one can probably Jedi oneself into doing the rational thing. One can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Violently oppose any attempts to shift one’s reference point after applying for a job. This may sound counterintuitive, but do not expect to get a job after applying for it. In this way, a rejection will be seen as a <strong>forgone gain</strong> and not a loss</li>
<li>After making such a commitment</li>
</ul>
